# Availability Calendar

A streamlined calendar application designed to help freelancers display their availability to clients. Built with modern web technologies and focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

## Overview

Managing availability as a freelancer alongside full-time employment can be challenging, especially when it comes to communicating your schedule to clients. This application solves that problem by providing a clean, accessible calendar interface where I can mark and update my availability for freelance work.

### Key Features

- 📅 Interactive calendar display
- 🌓 Dark/light mode support
- 🔒 Secure authentication for admin access
- 💻 Responsive design for all devices

## Problem & Solution

### The Challenge

As someone balancing full-time employment with freelance work, communicating availability to clients traditionally involved:

- Regular email updates with available time slots
- Screenshots of calendars with marked dates
- Back-and-forth communication to align schedules
- Manual coordination between multiple parties

### The Solution

This calendar application streamlines the process by:

- Providing a centralized, always-up-to-date view of availability
- Eliminating the need for repeated email updates
- Offering a clean interface that clients can check at their convenience
- Avoiding calendar pollution issues that arise from shared calendar solutions

Unlike sharing a Google Calendar, which can clutter clients' calendar views, this solution provides a dedicated, purpose-built platform for availability tracking.
